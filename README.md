# README - Ray Tracing Renderer

This project is a ray tracing renderer implemented in C++. It utilizes the principles of ray tracing to generate realistic 3D images by simulating the interaction of light with various objects in a scene.

## Features

- Supports rendering of spheres with different properties such as reflectivity, refraction, and hollowness.
- Implements direct lighting and indirect lighting for accurate shading.
- Supports reflection and refraction of light rays.
- Uses the Box-Muller transform for generating random numbers.
- Utilizes the cosine-weighted distribution for generating random directions.
- Implements Fresnel's law for determining the reflection probability.
- Supports rendering of a room with walls, ceiling, and floor.
- Utilizes OpenMP for parallel rendering to improve performance.

## Dependencies

- C++ compiler with C++11 support
- OpenMP library for parallel rendering
- `stb_image_write.h` and `stb_image.h` header files from the stb library for image I/O

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler with C++11 support and OpenMP enabled.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. The rendered image will be saved as `image.png` in the project directory.
